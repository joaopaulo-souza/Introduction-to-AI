<h1> Complexity </h1>

The complexity of an algorithm refers to the computational resources it requires to solve a given problem, typically measured in terms of time and space. Time complexity describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input, often expressed using Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(log n), O(n^2)). Space complexity, on the other hand, denotes the amount of memory an algorithm needs relative to the input size. Analyzing an algorithm's complexity helps in understanding its efficiency and scalability, enabling comparisons between different algorithms for the same task. Efficient algorithms are crucial for handling large datasets and ensuring optimal performance in real-world applications.
