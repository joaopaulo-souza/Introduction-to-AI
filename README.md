<h1> Introduction to AI </h1>

<p>
The aim of this article is to tell a little of the history of AI, and it's main concepts

The Turing Test was introduced by Alan Turing in <b>1950</b> in his seminal paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence"1. This test was designed to determine whether a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human.

<h3>The Turing Test</h3>
<p>
In its more generalized form, the Turing Test simplifies to involve only two participants: a human evaluator and a machine. The evaluator communicates with the machine (and potentially another human as a control) through text-based communication, typically over a computer. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine apart from the human based on the responses, the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test.

<p>
The term “artificial intelligence” was coined by John McCarthy in <b>1955</b>. He introduced it in a proposal for the Dartmouth Conference, which was held in 1956 and is considered the founding event of AI as a field.
</p>
<p>
Development of Lisp: John McCarthy developed the Lisp programming language in 1958, which became a fundamental tool for AI research due to its excellent support for symbolic reasoning and recursive functions23.

<b>The General Problem Solver (GPS)</b>, a pioneering computer program was developed in <b>1957</b> by Herbert A. Simon, J.C. Shaw, and Allen Newell at the RAND Corporation1. It was designed to work as a universal problem-solving machine, capable of solving a wide range of problems that could be expressed in a formal way.

<b>Key Features of GPS:</b>
<p>
Means-Ends Analysis: GPS uses a strategy called means-ends analysis, which involves breaking down a problem into smaller subgoals and solving each subgoal to move closer to the overall goal12.
</p>

<p>
Problem Space: It defines the problem space in terms of the goal to be achieved and the transformation rules that can be applied to reach that goal2.
Heuristics: GPS generates heuristics, or rules of thumb, to guide the problem-solving process1.
</p>

<p>
Separation of Knowledge and Strategy: One of its innovative aspects was separating the knowledge of the problem (rules) from the strategy of how to solve it (solver engine)1.
</p>


<h4>Applications and Limitations:</h4>
<p>
Applications: GPS was able to solve well-defined problems such as the Towers of Hanoi, proving theorems in logic or geometry, and word puzzles12.
</p>

<p>
Limitations: Despite its innovative approach, GPS struggled with real-world problems due to the combinatorial explosion, where the number of possible solutions became computationally infeasible1.
</p>

<b>1960s</b>: Research labs were established at universities such as MIT, Stanford, and Carnegie Mellon.

<b>1964</b>: ELIZA, an early natural language processing program, was developed by Joseph Weizenbaum

<b>Late 1970s</b>: The first "AI winter," a period of reduced interest and funding for AI research, began.
