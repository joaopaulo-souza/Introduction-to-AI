<h1> Introduction to AI </h1>

<p>
The aim of this article is to tell a little of the history of AI, and it's main concepts
</p>
<h2>What is an AI </h2>


An Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a type of system or machine created to handle tasks that usually demand human-level intelligence. Such tasks might involve acquiring knowledge, making logical deductions, solving problems, comprehending natural language, identifying patterns, and making decisions. AI systems accomplish these functions by using algorithms and models that analyze and interpret data, enabling them to learn from experiences, adjust to new information, and carry out intricate operations.



<h2>History of AI</h2>
<h3>Antiquity and mythology</h3>
The beginning of the history of AI remounts the Ancient Greek mythology. The concept of automata—self-operating machines or devices—can be seen in various myths featuring crafted beings endowed with life-like qualities. One notable example is the myth of Talos. Talos was made entirely of bronze and was animated by a single vein filled with a life-giving fluid, often described as molten metal or ichor, which was the divine essence of the gods. He was designed to patrol the shores of Crete and defend the island from hostile ships and invaders. Talos was said to be incredibly strong and could hurl massive rocks at approaching ships, creating a formidable barrier against any sea-borne threats. He had the ability to run around the island three times a day, ensuring that no enemy could land unnoticed.Even so, one day the Argonauts approached Crete on their quest for the Golden Fleece, they were met by Talos, who sought to prevent their landing. In some versions of the myth, the sorceress Medea, who was accompanying Jason, used her magic to deceive or trick Talos. In other versions, the Argonauts or Medea exploited Talos’s vulnerability by attacking his single vein of life-giving fluid, causing him to bleed out and collapse.

<h3>Renascence</h3>

Around 1500, Leonardo da Vinci, renowned for his genius in art and science, also made significant contributions to the concept of automata through his innovative designs. Among his creations were intricate mechanical devices such as a life-sized robotic knight capable of moving its arms, sitting, and even waving, showcasing Leonardo's advanced understanding of mechanical systems and robotics. He also envisioned a mechanical lion that could walk and roar, demonstrating his ability to blend artistry with engineering. Although these automata were never constructed during his lifetime, Leonardo’s detailed sketches and designs laid the groundwork for future developments in robotics and automation, reflecting his forward-thinking approach and profound influence on the field of mechanical engineering.

<h3> Modernity</h3>

Alan Turing's contributions to the field of artificial intelligence and computing are deeply intertwined with the concept of automata. Turing’s theoretical work on the concept of a "universal machine," now known as the Turing machine, laid the foundational principles for modern computing and algorithms. His idea of a universal machine capable of simulating any computational process was instrumental in understanding how machines could perform tasks that mimic intelligent behavior.


The Turing Test was introduced by Alan Turing in <b>1950</b> in his seminal paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence"1. This test was designed to determine whether a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human.

<h3>The Turing Test</h3>

In its more generalized form, the Turing Test simplifies to involve only two participants: a human evaluator and a machine. The evaluator communicates with the machine (and potentially another human as a control) through text-based communication, typically over a computer. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine apart from the human based on the responses, the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test.


The term “artificial intelligence” was coined by John McCarthy in <b>1955</b>. He introduced it in a proposal for the Dartmouth Conference, which was held in 1956 and is considered the founding event of AI as a field.

Development of Lisp: John McCarthy developed the Lisp programming language in 1958, which became a fundamental tool for AI research due to its excellent support for symbolic reasoning and recursive functions23.

<b>The General Problem Solver (GPS)</b>, a pioneering computer program was developed in <b>1957</b> by Herbert A. Simon, J.C. Shaw, and Allen Newell at the RAND Corporation1. It was designed to work as a universal problem-solving machine, capable of solving a wide range of problems that could be expressed in a formal way.

<b>Key Features of GPS:</b>
<p>
Means-Ends Analysis: GPS uses a strategy called means-ends analysis, which involves breaking down a problem into smaller subgoals and solving each subgoal to move closer to the overall goal12.
</p>

<p>
Problem Space: It defines the problem space in terms of the goal to be achieved and the transformation rules that can be applied to reach that goal2.
Heuristics: GPS generates heuristics, or rules of thumb, to guide the problem-solving process1.
</p>

<p>
Separation of Knowledge and Strategy: One of its innovative aspects was separating the knowledge of the problem (rules) from the strategy of how to solve it (solver engine)1.
</p>


<h4>Applications and Limitations:</h4>
<p>
Applications: GPS was able to solve well-defined problems such as the Towers of Hanoi, proving theorems in logic or geometry, and word puzzles12.
</p>

<p>
Limitations: Despite its innovative approach, GPS struggled with real-world problems due to the combinatorial explosion, where the number of possible solutions became computationally infeasible1.
</p>

<b>1960s</b>: Research labs were established at universities such as MIT, Stanford, and Carnegie Mellon.

<b>1964</b>: ELIZA, an early natural language processing program, was developed by Joseph Weizenbaum

<b>Late 1970s</b>: The first "AI winter," a period of reduced interest and funding for AI research, began.
