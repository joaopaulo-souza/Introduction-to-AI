# Introduction to Lisp Programming

Welcome to the my **Lisp Programming Tutorial**! This guide is designed to help you get started with Lisp, a powerful and flexible programming language known for its unique syntax and capabilities.

The tutorial is self explanatory and easy-to-use

You can start learning Lisp just by clicking <a href="https://github.com/joaopaulo-souza/Introduction-to-AI/blob/master/Lisp/lisp-tutorial.txt">lisp-tutorial.txt</a> or <a href="https://github.com/joaopaulo-souza/Introduction-to-AI/blob/master/Lisp/lisp-tutorial.lsp">lisp-tutorial.lsp</a> file. 

You can also take a look at this little project in lisp that calculates the Body Mass Index <a href="https://github.com/joaopaulo-souza/Introduction-to-AI/blob/master/Lisp/body-mass-index.lsp">(BMI)</a>
